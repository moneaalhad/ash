# ash
A simple shell written in C. Three builtin commands, and runs all the ones in /bin.

I'll add updates if and when I get the time, this is a work in progress.

`#include <sys/wait.h>`
`#include <unistd.h>`
`#include <stdlib.h>`
`#include <stdio.h>`
`#include <string.h>`

Include files required.
